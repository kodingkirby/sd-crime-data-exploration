# misc info
he Dispatch Priority System has six levels:
Priority Zero: Dispatch Immediately. Priority E calls involve an imminent
threat to life. Examples include: officer or person down, no detail accidents and
attempted suicide.
Priority One: Dispatch Immediately. Priority One calls involve serious crimes
in progress or a threat to life. Examples include: missing children, child abuse,
domestic violence, disturbances involving weapons/violence and bomb threats.
Priority Two: Dispatch as quickly as possible. Priority Two calls involve
complaints regarding less serious crimes in which there is no threat to life.
Examples include: prowlers who have left, preserve the peace, crime reports for
residents standing by at an inconvenient location, blocked driveway when the
caller is waiting to leave, injured animals, loud parties with mitigating
circumstances.
Priority Three: Dispatch as quickly as possible. Priority Three calls involve
minor crimes or requests for service which are not urgent. Examples include:
investigating a cold crime, loud parties involving noise only.
Priority Four: Dispatch when no higher priority calls are waiting. Priority
Four calls involve minor requests for police service. Examples include: found
property, most parking violations, etc.
Priority Nine: Calls that are formatted for the Telephone Report Unit (TRU).
Priority Nine calls involve requests for police service, which have limited or no
suspect information. Examples include: petty theft, vehicle break-in and false
use of anotherâ€™s identity.
The dispatch priority system is designed to be only a guide as a higher or lower
priority may be more appropriate
